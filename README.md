# MNIST-training

My testground for the basics of neural networks. Following a collection of resources found on the Internet:

* Michael Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
* Yani Ioannou's blog posts for deriving [single-layer backpropagation](https://blog.yani.ai/deltarule/) and [multi-layer backpropagation](https://blog.yani.ai/backpropagation/)

The implementation is in Python 3. Only NumPy and Matplotlib is required (see `./requirements.txt`).

## Database

The dataset for training and evaluation are obtained from [Yann LeCun's MNIST page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
